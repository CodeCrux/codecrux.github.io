        <p style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px; font-family: Rubik,sans-serif;color: #6b5875;">
          A web application is basically a software application program that
          applies web-based technologies to perform specific tasks. The
          application is built with various web technologies that include HTML,
          JS, CSS helpful storing databases, files etc. It is generally used by
          a team or a user for performing different tasks over the internet.
        </p>

        <p style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px; font-family: Rubik,sans-serif;color: #6b5875;">
          Web apps can be accessed via a web browser such as Google Chrome and
          involve a login/sign-up mechanism.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600; color: #462e52;">Web applications vs website: What is the difference?</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px; font-family: Rubik,sans-serif;color: #6b5875;">
          The main difference between web applications and websites is how we
          interact with each of them. Web applications are usually defined by
          their input. We can read, create, and delete data within a web
          application. Websites are generally defined by the output that they
          provide and that includes the news, the product information, the FAQs
          that we can read on the website.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600; color: #462e52;">What is the difference between Mobile Apps and Web Apps</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px; font-family: Rubik,sans-serif;color: #6b5875;">
          Any application that can be run on a mobile device like a tablet or a
          smartphone by providing service to its users can be categorized as a
          mobile application.
        </p>

        <p style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px; font-family: Rubik,sans-serif;color: #6b5875;">
          Mobile applications are exclusively designed for mobile gadgets and
          are suitable for iOS, Android, and Cross-platform operating systems.
          Most of the mobile apps like Google Maps, Uber, Amazon Kindle, etc.,
          work offline too. When it comes to web apps, they function only if you
          have internet connectivity. A web app only functions in real-time in a
          web browser that has CPU resources. A mobile app is downloadable from
          an app store as long as one has adequate internal storage.

          <b>Easy to update:</b>It is always easy to update web applications as
          only the server will require certain upgrades.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #6b5875;font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px; font-family: Rubik,sans-serif;">
          <b>Cross-platform capabilities:</b>Web applications can be run on any operating 
          system. They are also easily adaptable to Android, Windows Phones, Mac OS, iOS.

          up-gradation is easy to implement, it is easy and simple to increase the 
          application’s capacity to grow with your business or enterprise. Even if 
          issues occur, the servers can be easily replaced completely without affecting 
          the entire operating system.

           needs to develop the required features.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #6b5875;font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px; font-family: Rubik,sans-serif;">
          <b>Why Custom Web Application is good for Business:</b>
          All web applications can be built to provide a customized experience to their 
          users, but custom web applications are totally focused on serving a particular 
          market, enterprise, or audience needs. When developing a custom web application, 
          the total focus is on learning the various needs, utilizing the right technology
           that best fits in, and developing a tailored solution that addresses specific issues.

        <h2 style="color: #462e52; font-size: 40px; font-weight: 600;">Understanding differnt types of web application</h2>
        <h3 style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: 600; color: #462e52;margin-top: 2rem;">We have listed a few of the popular types of web applications here:</h3>
        <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px;color: #462e52;"><b>Static Web Applications</b></h4>
        <p style="color: #6b5875;font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px; font-family: Rubik,sans-serif;">Static web apps are basically static web pages displaying the same information
             to every visitor. Built by using HTML and CSS they offer no interactivity and 
             as the pages are generated on the server end, it does not leave any room for
              personalization. <br>
            Static web apps are good for certain businesses that only need low-key web pages that impart
            important business information and no inputs from the users. Business contact pages, personal
            portfolios and some company info pages can use static web apps. They are also quick and bring 
            in economical results.
        </p>
         <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem;font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px;color: #462e52;"><b>Dynamic Web Applications</b></h4>
        <p style="color: #6b5875;font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px; font-family: Rubik,sans-serif;">Dynamic web applications are interactive in nature and involve 
            client-side and server-side programming. The pages on dynamic 
            web apps do not have a pre-determined order of display. They are 
            in fact shaped by input on the server-side or client-side. A content 
            management system is deployed on these apps that further modify the app’s content
        </p>
        <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem;font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px;color: #462e52;"><b>Ecommerce apps</b></h4>
        <p style="color: #6b5875;font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px; font-family: Rubik,sans-serif;">A web app that helps businesses to place orders and process payments is called
             eCommerce apps. This takes the technical complexity of developing a web-based 
             app to the next level. There is a lot of programming involved in eCommerce web 
             apps and that includes maintaining an updated database of products to manage orders. 
        </p>
         <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem;font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px;color: #462e52;"><b>Content Management System</b></h4>
        <p style="color: #6b5875;font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px; font-family: Rubik,sans-serif;">Content Management System or CMS is used to manage and publish web 
            content and it allows multiple users to create, contribute, edit, publish.
             CMS is easier for people who do not possess technical skills and make 
             websites, publishes content, and edit content. All of these can be 
             done by simply using a dashboard.

         <h3 style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: 600; color: #462e52;margin-top: 2rem;">Conclusion</h3>
         <p style="color: #6b5875;font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px; font-family: Rubik,sans-serif;">In the end, all we can say is that the process of web and mobile
              application development is an important part of businesses. 
              Without these applications, businesses may find it difficult to 
              reach their customers in the digital world. Moreover, businesses 
              and users tend to prefer web apps for their functionality, amazing
               performance, and the great interaction feature they provide.
            </p>
            <p style="color: #6b5875;font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px; font-family: Rubik,sans-serif;">When you enable your future web app with some cool features and solutions
                 you can be sure to reach a huge base of clients and users. You can also 
                 stay in demand with the help of these web apps.
             </p>
             <p style="color: #6b5875;font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px; font-family: Rubik,sans-serif;">If you want your business to have a strong presence in the industry,

                  by the web and mobile world, then it becomes essential for you to invest
