          When it comes to programming languages, Ruby is quite a great language. Of all the advantages that we can talk about <strong> Ruby on Rails (RoR),</strong> it is its faster code development and fewer development hours which are very significant. In this age of technology, where superior websites and powerful online applications are the trends, you cannot just compromise with the performance and the quality. This is the prime reason why Rails is preferred for making <strong> modern web apps.</strong>
          <br>
