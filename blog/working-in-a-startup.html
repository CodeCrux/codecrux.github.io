		– You are not a valued employee. You are a pirate or a jedi instead.
		<br>
		– You work with a great bunch of motivated, talented and coolest geeks who are not shy to use F*** word a bit too frequently.
		<br>

		– Action may speak louder than words but code definitely speaks louder than any action!
		<br>

		– You are always updated about the coolest technical stuff happening all around the globe; thanks to the crazy folks all around you!
		<br>

		– You are not just a developer. You are a scrum-master, a deploy-king, a tester, a code-reviewer, a recruiter, an interviewer and sometimes you even get to pitch for your company! (If you are lucky enough..)
		<br>

		– You may feel intimidated and nervous at times!
		<br>

		– You learn the meaning of ownership and accountability.
		<br>

		– You continuously learn a lot of things simultaneously. Sometimes in a hardest way possible!
		<br>

		– Your mind suddenly gets tweaked to engage itself in provoking new thoughts and ideas.
		<br>

		– You are free to choose and explore new technologies. Start-ups don’t believe in legacy tech!
		<br>

		– Your ideas and grievances are heard effectively and immediately.
		<br>

		– You are expected to work hard and trained to work smart.
		<br>

		– You might get addicted to caffeine and beer in long run.
