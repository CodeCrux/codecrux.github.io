#### 1. **What is Ruby on Rails?**

**Answer**: Ruby on Rails is an open-source web development framework written in Ruby. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and emphasizes convention over configuration (CoC) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

#### 2. **What are the advantages of using Ruby on Rails?**

**Answer**:

-   Follows MVC architecture for modular code.
-   DRY and CoC principles improve code efficiency.
-   Built-in tools for database migration, scaffolding, and testing.
-   Large community and extensive libraries (gems).

#### 3. **Explain the MVC architecture in Rails.**

**Answer**:

-   **Model**: Handles data and business logic.
-   **View**: Manages the presentation layer (HTML, ERB templates).
-   **Controller**: Manages the application logic, processes user input, and interacts with the model and view.

#### 4. **What is Active Record?**

**Answer**: Active Record is the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer in Rails, which facilitates database interaction by representing data as objects.

#### 5. **What is a Rails gem?**

**Answer**: Gems are libraries or plugins that extend the functionality of a Ruby or Rails application.


#### 6. **What is the difference between `render` and `redirect_to` in Rails?**

**Answer**:

-   **render**: Renders a specific view template without making a new HTTP request.
-   **redirect_to**: Sends an HTTP redirect to the browser, which initiates a new request to a different URL.

#### 7. **What are Rails migrations?**

**Answer**: Rails migrations are used to make changes to the database schema over time in a consistent and version-controlled manner.

#### 8. **How does the `has_many :through` association work?**

**Answer**: It sets up a many-to-many connection between models using a third model to manage the relationship.

#### 9. **What is the Rails Asset Pipeline?**

**Answer**: The asset pipeline is used to manage and concatenate assets such as JavaScript, CSS, and images in a Rails application.

#### 10. **What are Rails callbacks?**

**Answer**: Callbacks are methods that get triggered at specific stages of an objectâ€™s lifecycle (e.g., `before_save`, `after_create`).


#### 11. **Explain eager loading and lazy loading in Rails.**

**Answer**:

-   **Eager loading**: Loads all associated records in a single query (e.g., `includes`).
-   **Lazy loading**: Loads associated records when they are accessed (e.g., `where` or `find`).

#### 12. **How does Rails handle security vulnerabilities?**

**Answer**: Rails includes protections against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) by default.

#### 13. **What are polymorphic associations in Rails?**

**Answer**: Polymorphic associations allow a model to belong to multiple other models using a single association.

#### 14. **What is the difference between `save` and `save!`?**

**Answer**:

-   `save`: Returns `true` or `false` based on validation.
-   `save!`: Raises an exception if validation fails.

#### 15. **What is Turbolinks in Rails?**

**Answer**: Turbolinks speeds up navigation by loading only the body and merging it into the current page without reloading JavaScript or CSS.


#### 16. **How do you set up a custom validation in Rails?**

**Answer**: Define a method in the model and use `validate`.

ruby

`class User < ApplicationRecord  

  validate :email_domain_check  
  

  private  
  def email_domain_check  
  
    errors.add(:email, "must be from example.com") unless email.include?("example.com")  
    
  end  
  
end` 

#### 17. **How do you handle file uploads in Rails?**

**Answer**: Use gems like `CarrierWave` or `ActiveStorage`.

**Answer**:

-   Use `includes` for eager loading.
-   Use `select` to fetch only necessary columns.
-   Avoid N+1 queries.

#### 19. **What is a Rails Concern? How do you use it?**

**Answer**: Concerns are modules used to extract reusable code in models and controllers. They are included using `include` or `extend`.

#### 20. **How do you implement caching in Rails?**

**Answer**:

-   **Fragment caching**: Cache parts of a view.
-   **Action caching**: Cache the entire output of an action.

#### 23. **Explain the Rails initialization process.**

**Answer**: It involves loading the `application.rb` file, initializing gems, and loading middleware, routes, and models.

#### 24. **How do you handle background jobs in Rails?**

**Answer**: Use tools like Sidekiq, Delayed Job, or Resque for asynchronous processing.

**Answer**: A Ruby library providing utility classes and extensions used by Rails.


### **55. What is an N+1 query problem in Rails?**

**Answer**:  
The N+1 query problem occurs when the application executes one query to retrieve the main records and then N additional queries to retrieve related records, causing inefficiency.  

**Solution**: Use `includes` to eager load associations:

ruby

`@posts = Post.includes(:comments)` 


### **56. How do you perform eager loading in Rails?**

**Answer**: Use the `includes` or `joins` method in ActiveRecord to load associated records in fewer queries.

`rake db:migrate` 


### **58. What are `joins` and `includes` in Rails? How are they different?**

**Answer**:

-   **joins**: Performs an SQL join but doesnâ€™t load associated records.

  def record_not_found
  
    render plain: '404 Not Found', status: 404
    
  end
  
end` 



### **61. What is Railsâ€™ asset pipeline?**

  has_secure_password
  
end` 


### **82. What is the purpose of `ActiveJob` in Rails?**

en:

  hello: "Hello World"` 

Usage in views:

erb

`<%= t('hello') %>` 


### **84. What are concerns in Rails, and when do you use them?**

**Answer**:  
Concerns are modules used to extract and reuse common functionality across models or controllers. They help keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).  
Example:

ruby

`module Archivable

  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
  
    scope :archived, -> { where(archived: true) }
    
  end
  
end`

**Answer**:

-   **Optimistic locking**: Uses a `lock_version` column to ensure no conflicting updates.
-   **Pessimistic locking**: Locks a database row until the transaction is complete, preventing others from modifying it.  
    Example of pessimistic locking:

ruby

`user = User.lock("FOR UPDATE").find(1)` 


### **86. What is the difference between `polymorphic` and `single table inheritance` (STI) in Rails?**

**Answer**:

-   **Polymorphic associations**: Allow a model to belong to multiple other models using a shared interface.
-   **STI**: Allows multiple classes to inherit from a single database table.



### **87. What is a PORO in Rails?**

**Answer**:  
PORO stands for "Plain Old Ruby Object." It refers to simple Ruby classes that aren't dependent on Rails. They are used for business logic that doesnâ€™t fit into models or controllers.


### **88. How do you use Rails helpers?**

**Answer**:  
Helpers are used to encapsulate reusable view logic.  
Example:

ruby

`module ApplicationHelper

  def format_date(date)

  end
  
end` 

Usage in views:

erb



`<%= format_date(Time.now) %>`

**Answer**:  
Partials are reusable view templates.  
Example: Create `_form.html.erb` and render it using:

erb

`<%= render 'form' %>` 


### **91. How do you debug a Rails application?**

**Answer**:  
Use tools like:

-   `byebug` or `debugger` gem for setting breakpoints.
-   Logs (`log/development.log`).
-   Browser developer tools for frontend issues.


### **92. What is the difference between `render` and `redirect_to`?**

**Answer**:

-   `render`: Renders a specific template without making a new HTTP request.
-   `redirect_to`: Issues a new HTTP request to a different action or URL.


### **93. What are scopes in Rails?**

**Answer**:  
Scopes are methods for defining reusable queries in models.  

**Example:**

ruby

`scope :active, -> { where(active: true) }` 


### **94. What is Rails' `ActiveSupport::Concern`?**

**Answer**:  
It is a module used to include shared functionality in classes. It provides `included` and `class_methods` blocks for extending functionality.


### **95. How do you create a custom generator in Rails?**

**Answer**:  
Create a generator under the `lib/generators` directory.  
Example:

**Answer**:  
The `environment.rb` file initializes the Rails application and loads all configurations.


### **97. What is the difference between `has_many :through` and `has_and_belongs_to_many`?**

**Answer**:

-   **has_many :through**: Requires an intermediate join model.
-   **has_and_belongs_to_many**: Direct many-to-many relationship without an intermediate model.



### **98. How do you handle background jobs in Rails?**

**Answer**:  
Use gems like Sidekiq, Resque, or DelayedJob to manage background jobs.



### **99. What is a serializer in Rails?**
