    <div class="accordion">
      <div class="icon"></div>
      <h5>Why your company might need Android application services?</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
       
According to Statista, 4 million people will own smartphones by 2020. As Android is the most popular platform in the world, many of those devices will be operating on it. Hence, mobile app development for Android can help your idea reach a massive audience. Still, finding a partner that can provide reliable Android app development services remains a challenge. The platform works on a large number of different devices, gets frequent updates, the functionality is always expanding, and more. Therefore, finding Android application developers who continuously learn and know the ins and outs of the platform is critical to your project’s success.

      <h5>What should I pay attention to while looking for Android application developers?</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
       
Above all, you should account for their level of expertise. Many companies are interested in Android development services, so many service providers have emerged to capitalize on the demand. Expectedly, not every company can deliver a reliable Android application. When you select a partner for Android app development services, pay attention to the technologies their developers use, the company’s portfolio, and what clients say about the company.

    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Our engineers pay as much attention to Android web application development as to any other integral part of the product. If it is a mobile project with a web version, we put the same level of effort into both. We always follow all of the platforms requirements closely, including the ones for web-based content (for examples, the need to create user-friendly experiences on Android App Links and Search).

      <h5>How Codecrux meets the current trends in native Android app development?</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
      
Being a common challenge, native app development for Android deserves special attention from any software development company. For Codecrux, it means understanding the most useful and efficient techniques that will help our clients outperform their competitors on the market. Our Android applications development team utilizes the statistical insights collected by top consulting companies and analytical agencies. According to the list of categories that call for Android development services in 2019 and beyond, we recommend our clients to adopt Android for crafting enterprise tools, communication apps, video programs, and travel services. In case the client comes from the education, lifestyle, or gaming industry, we advise replacing native Android mobile application development with a cross-platform approach.
