            <h3 id="User-experience-and-design ">User experience and design  </h3>
            <p>One of the significant factors to consider before you figure out the capabilities of an app development company, is what UI/UX can attract the target audience. These days, it is not the simplicity of designs that work, but the team should reflect the freshness in their intuitive UI/UX theme.  And you also need to think about the whole package as building an app is not just about coding. A functional design is important and so is user experience. You need to go a step further to look for agencies who can add value in both design and user experience of your web and mobile app, further designing how users interact with your product.

Determining your budget is even more important if the app is central to your business model. So, instead of rushing after the agency which offers the cheapest price estimate and get delivered what you pay for, look for the agency that offers you value for the money.
