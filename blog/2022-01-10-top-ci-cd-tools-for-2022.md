## What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for countinous integration and countinous deployment or delivery, CI and CD revolve around three major processes in the development of software: Build, Test and Deploy.

**Continuous integration** integrates the code continuously on the existing code. A popular version controlling system such as Git serves the issues of integrating the code from multiple developers. This is counted as the primary stage of our pipeline. Once we have pushed the code into the shared repository and integrated it, the next stage comes the continuous delivery.

**Continuous Delivery** is the next step and as the name suggests, it aims towards continuously delivering the newly integrated code to the end-users.
