        <p>The way you engage your current customers plays a vital role in how you attract potential customers when it comes to real estate companies. Real estate is all about building trust, and it's no wonder that 82% of new property transactions are referrals from current contacts, former buyers, families, acquaintances, or relatives. Basically, by helping them handle their incoming leads, monitor interactions, and stay on top of important tasks, implementing a CRM programme will work wonders for realtors.
