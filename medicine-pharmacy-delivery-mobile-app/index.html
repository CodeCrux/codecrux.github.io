           An "interaction" is basically any communication that people do with your application or website.
           <br>
          For example, when people buy products/services from your webshop, what would be the next step after they add their item to their cart? If there is an error, while carrying the activity, will the data or the interaction they have done will be deleted?
          <br>
          Here's where we help you. We identify, evaluate and design the interactions that is done with your products and services online. All the interactions are properly coordinated and orchestrated by us to make sure that they are consistent with your website’s information architecture, business goals and your customer’s expectations.

          Visual design is the “look” in the “look and feel” but it’s also much more. Visual design gives a face to your brand, builds an emotional connection and ensures the proper communication of ideas and functions. Our visual designers have a broad understanding of business environments. Their main task is to listen to your needs and come up with creative solutions; it’s all about communication.
          <br>
          Visual design is the agent that establishes a clear understanding of the purpose and meaning of your solution. We design and create websites and web apps, mobile and tablet apps, corporate identities and icons to name but a few.
