        <div>
            <h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600">Javascript</h3>
            <p class="mar-t1">
                <a href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">JavaScript</a> is one the most well-known programming languages, with strong 
                demand and a strong following. JavaScript is used by many well-known IT 
                companies such as Uber, Google, Microsoft, Uber, and Microsoft. Although 
                the language is best known for its ability to add responsive elements to 
                web pages, there are many other uses.
            </p>
            <p class="font-weight-400 mar-t1">    
                The language can be used for both front-end as well as back-end development. 
                Developers find it attractive because of its interoperability with well-known 
                frameworks like Vue, Node, and React.
            </p>
            <p class="mar-t1">    
                It seems reasonable to expect JavaScript to continue to dominate the web in 
                2022, given the number of websites that heavily rely on JavaScript.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600">Python</h3>
            <p class="mar-t1">
                <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">Python</a> is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
                 The use of considerable indentation in its design philosophy promotes code readability. 
                 The language uses elements and object-oriented approaches that are aimed at assisting 
                 programmers, to write clear and logical codes for small and large-scale projects. 
                 Whether it’s for iOS or Android app development, employers are widely hiring developers 
                 who know how to code using Python.

        <div>
            <h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600">C/C++</h3>
            <p class="mar-t1">Even though it’s an oldie among the programming languages, C and C++ are 
               generally used by people who continue to work on Microsoft and Windows. 
               These programming languages are suitable options for video game developers as 
               they can be utilized for various applications and also for Unity 3D as well. 
            </p>
            <p class="mar-t1">   
               C is a general-purpose procedural language used for creating low-level systems 
               like operating systems, kernel programming, and other applications. Many other 
               programming languages can borrow from the characteristics of this language.
            </p>
            <p class="mar-t1">
               <a href="https://isocpp.org/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">C++</a> is a programming language that emphasizes objects and was originally 
               developed to extend C. It is widely used in many industries including competitive 
               programming, GUI, desktop, and game development.
            </p>
        </div>

        

        <div>
            <h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600">Java</h3>
            <p class="mar-t1">
              <a href="https://www.java.com/en/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">Java</a> is an object-oriented programming language and is also one of the most 
              popular ones. Its well-known concept of write-once can run everywhere, which 
              allows Java programs to run on any system that runs on Java, without the need 
              for recompilation. Specialists use it to work on web development, virtual applications 
              for mobile phones and desktop devices.
            </p>
            <p class="mar-t1">
              It is used in creating Android apps, web, desktop, and scientific applications. 
              Top-tier companies like Flipkart and Amazon use Java, which offers attractive 
              job opportunities for Java engineers.

            </p>
        </div>

       
        <div>
            <h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600">TypeScript</h3>
            <p class="mar-t1"> 
               <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">TypeScript</a> is the superset of JavaScript and has almost the same applications 
               as JavaScript. TypeScript can be used in web development, mobile app development, 
               desktop app development, and so on. TypeScript is the second most popular language
               as mentioned by StackOverflow’s list of most loved languages, being loved by 67.1% 
               of developers (being second only to Rust).
            </p>
            <p class="mar-t1">
               The language has a much lower skill ceiling than JavaScript – and many 
               “difficult-to-understand” behaviors of JavaScript have been simplified in TypeScript. 
               In other words, you have a slightly less chance of knocking your head into a wall.

        <div>
            <h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600"> R Language </h3>
            <p class="mar-t1">
                Many big tech companies like Uber, Google, and Facebook use an <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">R programming language </a>
                to run their businesses. With the increasing demand for machine learning and data science, 
                it is worth learning the R programming language.
            </p>
            <p class="mar-t1">
                It is an open-source programming platform that includes a wide range of libraries and frameworks. 
                It can also be integrated into data processing platforms like Hadoop or Spark.
            </p>
        </div>
       

        <div>
            <h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600">Kotlin</h3>
            <p class="mar-t1">
                <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">Kotlin</a> is a general-purpose programming language originally developed and unveiled as Project 
                Kotlin by JetBrains in 2011. The first version was officially released in 2016. It is 
                interoperable with Java and supports functional programming languages.
            </p>
            <p class="mar-t1">
                The language is easy to learn and can be used to build online and Android applications. 
                Javalin and KTor are the most widely used Kotlin frameworks. Experts like this language 
                because Kotlin is a preferred Google choice and the company has been implementing it in its operations since 2017.
            </p>
        </div>
       

        <div>
            <h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600">GoLang</h3>
            <p class="mar-t1">
                New languages are rapidly rising on the horizon, with new contenders coming up to challenge 
                the throne owned by JavaScript and Python. Being made by Google (both have “Go” in their names!) 
                mainly to advance the cause of functional programming, Golang has built up a mass following within 
                a short time. Golang has already made it the fifth-best language to learn by StackOverflow, being 
                adored by 62.3% of developers.
            </p>
            <p class="mar-t1">
                <a href="https://go.dev/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">Golang</a> is used in multiple areas, both for developing robust software as well as the backends 
                used for web and mobile applications. Currently, Golang even supports some rudimentary amount 
                of web development. While it’s still not in a phase to replace JavaScript as the language of 
                the web, it is fast becoming a language that supports the next phase of the web.
            </p>
            <p class="mar-t1">
                Golang is slightly more difficult to learn than the other languages on this list. Moreover, 
                Golang is an open-source language that frequently changes with every major update, so staying 
                updated is a necessity.

        <div>
            <h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600">C#</h3>
            <p class="mar-t1">
                Developed by Microsoft, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">C#</a> rose to fame in the 2000s for supporting the concepts of 
                object-oriented programming. It is one of the most used programming languages for the 
                .NET framework. Anders Hejlsberg, the creator of C#, says the language is more like C++ than Java. 
            </p>
            <p class="mar-t1">
                It is best suited for applications on Windows, Android, and iOS, as it takes the help of the 
                integrated development environment product, Microsoft Visual C++. C# is used on the back end 
                of several popular websites like Bing, Dell, Visual Studio, and MarketWatch. C# developers earn around $68,500 per year.
            </p>
            <p class="mar-t1">
                C# is also used to build cross-platform mobile applications on the Xamarin platform. By using C#, you can write 
                lengthy programs in just a few lines with Xamarin and then deploy them to both the leading mobile platforms, 
                i.e., iOS and Android, simultaneously.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600">Swift</h3>
            <p class="mar-t1">
                <a href="https://www.swift.org/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">Swift</a> has been in the industry since 2014 and is mostly used for developing applications for 
                iOS. Even though the language is quite new, experts think that it deserves high priority. 
                With features like open-source code and simple syntax, one of its greatest advantages is its 
                superb integration with Objective-C. Also, Swift can be integrated with FlappyBird, Mozilla Firefox, 
                and WordPress.
                An open-source programming language that is easy to learn, Swift supports almost everything from 
                the programming language Objective-C. Swift requires fewer coding skills compared with other 
                programming languages, and it can be used with IBM Swift Sandbox and IBM Bluemix. Swift is used 
                in popular iOS apps like WordPress, Mozilla Firefox, SoundCloud, and even in the game Flappy Bird. 
                Professionals who develop iOS applications take home average annual salaries of around $96,000.
