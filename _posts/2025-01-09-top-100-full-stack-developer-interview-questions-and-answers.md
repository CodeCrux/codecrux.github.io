Here’s a comprehensive list of **top 100 full-stack developer interview questions and answers** covering front-end, back-end, database, and general topics. Due to the character limit, I’ll list key questions and answers in various categories. Let me know if you’d like this expanded or need a document for easier reference.

### **General Full-Stack Questions**
1. **What is a Full-Stack Developer?**  
   A full-stack developer works on both front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) parts of a web application.

2. **What is the difference between full-stack and MEAN/MERN stack?**  
   - MEAN: MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js  
   - MERN: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js  
   These are JavaScript-based stacks, while "full-stack" is a general term for working on both front-end and back-end.

3. **What is RESTful API?**  
   REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications using stateless communication via HTTP.

4. **What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?**  
   - SQL: Relational, structured schema (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).  
   - NoSQL: Non-relational, flexible schema (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).

5. **What are HTTP status codes?**  
   - 200: OK  
   - 404: Not Found  
   - 500: Internal Server Error

### **Front-End Development**
6. **What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?**  
   HTML5 introduced new tags like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<audio>`, `<video>`, and supports offline storage and multimedia.

7. **What is the DOM?**  
   The DOM (Document Object Model) represents an HTML document as a tree structure where each node is an element.

8. **What are CSS flexbox and grid?**  
   - Flexbox: One-dimensional layout (row/column).  
   - Grid: Two-dimensional layout (rows and columns).

9. **What are media queries in CSS?**  
   Media queries allow you to apply styles based on device properties like screen width (`@media screen and (max-width: 768px)`).

10. **What is React Virtual DOM?**  
    React's Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the DOM, used for efficient UI updates by minimizing direct DOM manipulation.

### **JavaScript**
11. **What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?**  
    - `var`: Function-scoped, hoisted.  
    - `let`: Block-scoped, not hoisted.  
    - `const`: Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned.

12. **What is asynchronous JavaScript?**  
    Asynchronous JavaScript (e.g., using Promises or `async/await`) allows non-blocking operations like API calls.

13. **What is the purpose of closures?**  
    Closures allow a function to access variables from its outer scope even after the outer function has returned.

14. **What are JavaScript frameworks commonly used in full-stack development?**  
    - Front-end: React, Angular, Vue.js.  
    - Back-end: Node.js, Express.js.

15. **What is CORS?**  
    Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain.

### **Back-End Development**
16. **What is Node.js?**  
    Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, enabling server-side scripting.

17. **What is middleware in Express.js?**  
    Middleware functions handle requests, responses, or errors in Express.js applications.

18. **What is the difference between monolithic and microservices architecture?**  
    - Monolithic: Single codebase.  
    - Microservices: Decoupled, independently deployable services.

19. **What is JWT?**  
    JSON Web Token is used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, often for authentication.

20. **What are some popular backend frameworks?**  
    - Node.js (Express.js, Nest.js)  
    - Python (Django, Flask)  
    - Ruby (Ruby on Rails)

### **Database**
21. **What is indexing in databases?**  
    Indexing improves database query performance by creating a data structure that allows quick data retrieval.

22. **What is the difference between `DELETE`, `DROP`, and `TRUNCATE` in SQL?**  
    - `DELETE`: Removes specific rows.  
    - `TRUNCATE`: Removes all rows, faster.  
    - `DROP`: Deletes the table itself.

23. **What is ACID in database transactions?**  
    ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability, ensuring reliable transactions.

24. **What is MongoDB, and how does it store data?**  
    MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents.

25. **What are database relationships?**  
    - One-to-One  
    - One-to-Many  
    - Many-to-Many

### **DevOps and Deployment**
26. **What is Docker?**  
    Docker is a platform for containerizing applications, ensuring they run consistently in any environment.

27. **What is CI/CD?**  
    Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment automates code integration, testing, and deployment pipelines.

28. **What is the purpose of load balancing?**  
    Distributes network traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and reliability.

29. **What is the difference between a virtual machine and a container?**  
    - VM: Full OS with hardware virtualization.  
    - Container: Lightweight, shares the host OS kernel.

30. **What is Kubernetes?**  
    Kubernetes is an orchestration tool for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.

---

### **Miscellaneous**
31. **What is the purpose of version control (e.g., Git)?**  
    Version control manages changes to source code, allowing collaboration and history tracking.

32. **What are WebSockets?**  
    WebSockets enable full-duplex communication between a client and server in real-time.

33. **What is GraphQL?**  
    GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs, providing more flexibility than REST.

34. **What is CSRF and how to prevent it?**
