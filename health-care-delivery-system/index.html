          How new Health care platform will improve patient care. Without another new entrant announcing his foray into healthcare, not a day goes by.
          Best Buy grew from selling gadgets to deploying its Geek Squad for repairs to offering home health facilities to remote surveillance through a series of strategic acquisitions. 
          As the president of the organisation indicated, it will take some "interesting new bedfellows" to achieve the goal of reducing the spiralling costs of healthcare

          When patient care becomes more concentrated and the number of touchpoints and data inputs grows, care teams need a "single screen" view of the whole patient experience, which John Halamka, executive director of Beth Israel Lahey Health's Health Technology Exploration Center, has cleverly named "care traffic control
          <br>
          By seeing medical background alongside details on jobs, socioeconomic status, and other social determinants of health, Piedmont care teams will get a more comprehensive view of the patient.
          The same patient profiles can be used by in-home services to flag gaps around items such as safe food accessibility or transportation that could put patients back in the hospital with chronic conditions. Outreach teams may send reminders or run focused campaigns around items like wellness courses, armed with this knowledge and the insights created, to engage patients in more personalised ways. The ultimate aim is to have, at a lower overall cost of treatment, a more organised, personalised patient experience.

        Coordinating patient care through an enlarged and more complex world can only become more difficult with the tsunami of information coming from these new outlets, even with the right resources in place. In the next five years, a recent Multinational Data Organization study expects a 36 percent growth rate for healthcare data, higher than in any other sector.
        <br>
        A new analysis of 24 of the market's top medical apps showed that 79 percent exchanged user information in ways that could compromise privacy. The traditional role of the physician as trusted gatekeeper starts to break down as data passes into patient hands. She has privacy rights if you share health details with your physician. If you share it with Alexa or Google Home, it does not enforce the same privacy rules.

          <h3>1.Easy registration and login</h3>
          <p> Registration and login are the first steps of interaction with patients and doctors.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = box>
          <h3>2.Profile access and modification:</h3>
          <p> Creating a profile should be easy and handy. Users should be allowed to upload their photos and any other information that they want to share.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = box>
          <h3> 3. Searching and consulting Doctors:</h3>
          <p> The best healthcare app should have a Smart filter to search and filter the doctors based on their specialization, experience, reviews, consulting fee, education, location, etc.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = box>
          <h3> 4. Selecting Doctors:</h3>
          <p> Patients should be able to choose and select the Doctors according to their search results after the filters.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = box>
          <h3>5. Appointment management:  </h3>
          <p> The doctors should get authorization to accept or deny consultation requests if, for some reason, they do not wish to see the patient or the timings are not available.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = box>
          <h3>6. Make your website mobile friendly</h3>
          <p> The mobile device is the new gatekeeper, in essence. It must be easy to use on the smallest screen available if you want your patients, prospective patients, and staff to use your website.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = box>
          <h3>7. Create a wide range of content for patient and other health care end users</h3>
          <p> The need for it is already there. People from a reputable source they trust want to learn more about their healthcare. 
            The more the customer is educated, the lower the total healthcare rate. Cost reductions that do not cut care are necessary with burgeoning expenses.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = box>
          <h3>8. Personalise your website experience</h3>
          <p> Imagine, for instance, running a small practise with a customer portal. To make a daily appointment, a patient who is trying to stop smoking logs in. That could be an opportunity to provide them with content from inside your system about smoking cessation</p>
        </div>

        <div class = box>
          <h3>9. Develop secure communication channels</h3>
          <p>  Private companies , particularly service providers, have gone beyond simple telephone support to include other platforms such as ticketing systems, live chat, chatbots, and aid powered by social media. The same would need to be achieved by healthcare professionals.</p>
