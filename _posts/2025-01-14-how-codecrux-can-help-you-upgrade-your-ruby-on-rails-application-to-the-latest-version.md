## CodeCrux’s Proven Process for Upgrading Ruby on Rails

At CodeCrux, we follow a systematic and thorough process to upgrade your application safely and efficiently. Here’s how we do it:

### Step 1: **Initial Assessment and Planning**

Our team begins by conducting a comprehensive assessment of your application:

- Analyze the current Rails version and identify gaps.
- Audit dependencies to determine compatibility with the target Rails version.
- Evaluate the state of your test suite and application documentation.

**Value Added:** We provide you with a detailed upgrade plan, including timelines, potential risks, and solutions to address them.

---

### Step 2: **Upgrading Dependencies**

Outdated gems are often the biggest challenge during a Rails upgrade. Our team:

- Identifies and updates outdated gems.
- Replaces unmaintained gems with modern alternatives.
- Ensures compatibility of third-party integrations.

**Value Added:** CodeCrux offers curated recommendations for gem replacements and optimizations to future-proof your app.

---

### Step 3: **Strengthening the Test Suite**

We recognize that a reliable test suite is essential for a successful upgrade. If your tests are incomplete or outdated, we:

- Enhance test coverage for critical application components.
- Update existing tests to align with new Rails features.
- Perform integration and end-to-end testing to catch regressions.

**Value Added:** Our expertise in testing ensures your application is stable and functions as expected after the upgrade.

---

### Step 4: **Incremental Upgrades**

Rather than jumping multiple versions at once, we:

- Upgrade one major version at a time (e.g., from Rails 5.2 to 6.0, then to 7.0).
- Test the application thoroughly at each stage.
- Address breaking changes and deprecations incrementally.

**Value Added:** This phased approach minimizes risks and ensures a smoother transition.

---

### Step 5: **Configuration and Codebase Cleanup**

During the upgrade, we:

- Refactor deprecated methods and syntax.
- Update configuration files to adopt new Rails defaults.
- Remove unused code, database columns, and assets.

**Value Added:** Our clean-up process improves code quality and simplifies future maintenance.

---

### Step 6: **Deployment and Post-Upgrade Monitoring**

Once the upgrade is complete, we:

- Deploy the updated application to a staging environment for final testing.
- Monitor production logs and metrics post-deployment to ensure stability.
- Provide ongoing support to address any issues that arise.

**Value Added:** We ensure your application runs smoothly post-upgrade, providing peace of mind.
