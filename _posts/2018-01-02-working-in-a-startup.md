        – You are not a valued employee. You are a pirate or a jedi instead.
        <br />
        – You work with a great bunch of motivated, talented and coolest geeks
        who are not shy to use F*** word a bit too frequently.
        <br />

        – Action may speak louder than words but code definitely speaks louder
        than any action!
        <br />

        – You are always updated about the coolest technical stuff happening all
        around the globe; thanks to the crazy folks all around you!
        <br />

        – You are not just a developer. You are a scrum-master, a deploy-king, a
        tester, a code-reviewer, a recruiter, an interviewer and sometimes you
        even get to pitch for your company! (If you are lucky enough..)
        <br />

        – You may feel intimidated and nervous at times!
        <br />

        – You learn the meaning of ownership and accountability.
        <br />

        – You continuously learn a lot of things simultaneously. Sometimes in a
        hardest way possible!
        <br />

        – Your mind suddenly gets tweaked to engage itself in provoking new
        thoughts and ideas.
        <br />

        – You are free to choose and explore new technologies. Start-ups don’t
        believe in legacy tech!
        <br />

        – Your ideas and grievances are heard effectively and immediately.
        <br />

        – You are expected to work hard and trained to work smart.
        <br />

        – You might get addicted to caffeine and beer in long run.
