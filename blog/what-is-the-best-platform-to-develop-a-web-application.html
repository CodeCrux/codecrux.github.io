            revamped in 2016. A javascript-based open-source framework, it has
            been considered to be one of the go-to platforms for building
            web-based applications. The framework is great for mobile eCommerce,
            video streaming, travel apps, and review applications. Google,
            Netflix, Upwork, PayPal are the most popular applications built on
            AngularJS. The framework also helps you make single web-page
            applications by using an MVC (Model-Controller-View) architectural
            pattern.

            Node.js, a powerful JavaScript-based platform, is one of the best to
            build highly efficient web applications. This particular framework
            is great for making single-page web apps, video streaming sites, and

            feed, store, chat, etc. Each module may not depend on others and all
            together, a single structure is formed by them. Node.js is a go-to
            environment for web app development because of its JavaScript
            language with an active community and millions of free tools.
