<p>As systems and applications are constantly changing, programming languages 
    are also evolving in both industry and research. Today, there is a wide variety 
    of programming languages with various syntaxes and features. Developers can now
    choose languages based on the clients’ preferences or their own. As the software
    development industry is rapidly evolving, the industry is demanding its professionals
    to acquire the knowledge of more lucrative tools and applications and get a deeper 
    understanding of the latest top programming languages. In this vast industry, 
    professionals may find several programming languages to learn, but experts believe
    not all of them are equally necessary.Today, we will list the top programming 
    languages for 2022 that experts think are crucial.</p>


<h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600">1. Javascript</h3>
<p class="mar-t1">
    <a href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">JavaScript</a> is one the most well-known programming languages, with strong 
    demand and a strong following. JavaScript is used by many well-known IT 
    companies such as Uber, Google, Microsoft, Uber, and Microsoft. Although 
    the language is best known for its ability to add responsive elements to 
    web pages, there are many other uses.
</p>
<p class="font-weight-400 mar-t1">    
    The language can be used for both front-end as well as back-end development. 
    Developers find it attractive because of its interoperability with well-known 
    frameworks like Vue, Node, and React.
</p>
<p class="mar-t1">    
    It seems reasonable to expect JavaScript to continue to dominate the web in 
    2022, given the number of websites that heavily rely on JavaScript.
</p>



<h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600">2. Python</h3>
<p class="mar-t1">
    <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">Python</a> is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
        The use of considerable indentation in its design philosophy promotes code readability. 
        The language uses elements and object-oriented approaches that are aimed at assisting 
        programmers, to write clear and logical codes for small and large-scale projects. 
        Whether it’s for iOS or Android app development, employers are widely hiring developers 
        who know how to code using Python.
</p>

<h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600">3. C/C++</h3>
<p class="mar-t1">Even though it’s an oldie among the programming languages, C and C++ are 
    generally used by people who continue to work on Microsoft and Windows. 
    These programming languages are suitable options for video game developers as 
    they can be utilized for various applications and also for Unity 3D as well. 
</p>
<p class="mar-t1">   
    C is a general-purpose procedural language used for creating low-level systems 
    like operating systems, kernel programming, and other applications. Many other 
    programming languages can borrow from the characteristics of this language.
</p>
<p class="mar-t1">
    <a href="https://isocpp.org/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">C++</a> is a programming language that emphasizes objects and was originally 
    developed to extend C. It is widely used in many industries including competitive 
    programming, GUI, desktop, and game development.
</p>
<h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600">4. Java</h3>
<p class="mar-t1">
    <a href="https://www.java.com/en/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">Java</a> is an object-oriented programming language and is also one of the most 
    popular ones. Its well-known concept of write-once can run everywhere, which 
    allows Java programs to run on any system that runs on Java, without the need 
    for recompilation. Specialists use it to work on web development, virtual applications 
    for mobile phones and desktop devices.
</p>
<p class="mar-t1">
    It is used in creating Android apps, web, desktop, and scientific applications. 
    Top-tier companies like Flipkart and Amazon use Java, which offers attractive 
    job opportunities for Java engineers.

</p>
<h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600">5. TypeScript</h3>
<p class="mar-t1"> 
    <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">TypeScript</a> is the superset of JavaScript and has almost the same applications 
    as JavaScript. TypeScript can be used in web development, mobile app development, 
    desktop app development, and so on. TypeScript is the second most popular language
    as mentioned by StackOverflow’s list of most loved languages, being loved by 67.1% 
    of developers (being second only to Rust).
</p>
<p class="mar-t1">
    The language has a much lower skill ceiling than JavaScript – and many 
    “difficult-to-understand” behaviors of JavaScript have been simplified in TypeScript. 
    In other words, you have a slightly less chance of knocking your head into a wall.


</p>


<h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600">6. R Language </h3>
<p class="mar-t1">
    Many big tech companies like Uber, Google, and Facebook use an <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">R programming language </a>
    to run their businesses. With the increasing demand for machine learning and data science, 
    it is worth learning the R programming language.
</p>
<p class="mar-t1">
    It is an open-source programming platform that includes a wide range of libraries and frameworks. 
    It can also be integrated into data processing platforms like Hadoop or Spark.
</p>
<h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600">7. Kotlin</h3>
<p class="mar-t1">
    <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">Kotlin</a> is a general-purpose programming language originally developed and unveiled as Project 
    Kotlin by JetBrains in 2011. The first version was officially released in 2016. It is 
    interoperable with Java and supports functional programming languages.
</p>
<p class="mar-t1">
    The language is easy to learn and can be used to build online and Android applications. 
    Javalin and KTor are the most widely used Kotlin frameworks. Experts like this language 
    because Kotlin is a preferred Google choice and the company has been implementing it in its operations since 2017.
</p>
<h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600">8. GoLang</h3>
<p class="mar-t1">
    New languages are rapidly rising on the horizon, with new contenders coming up to challenge 
    the throne owned by JavaScript and Python. Being made by Google (both have “Go” in their names!) 
    mainly to advance the cause of functional programming, Golang has built up a mass following within 
    a short time. Golang has already made it the fifth-best language to learn by StackOverflow, being 
    adored by 62.3% of developers.
</p>
<p class="mar-t1">
    <a href="https://go.dev/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">Golang</a> is used in multiple areas, both for developing robust software as well as the backends 
    used for web and mobile applications. Currently, Golang even supports some rudimentary amount 
    of web development. While it’s still not in a phase to replace JavaScript as the language of 
    the web, it is fast becoming a language that supports the next phase of the web.
</p>
<p class="mar-t1">
    Golang is slightly more difficult to learn than the other languages on this list. Moreover, 
    Golang is an open-source language that frequently changes with every major update, so staying 
    updated is a necessity.
</p>
<h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600">9. C#</h3>
<p class="mar-t1">
    Developed by Microsoft, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">C#</a> rose to fame in the 2000s for supporting the concepts of 
    object-oriented programming. It is one of the most used programming languages for the 
    .NET framework. Anders Hejlsberg, the creator of C#, says the language is more like C++ than Java. 
</p>
<p class="mar-t1">
    It is best suited for applications on Windows, Android, and iOS, as it takes the help of the 
    integrated development environment product, Microsoft Visual C++. C# is used on the back end 
    of several popular websites like Bing, Dell, Visual Studio, and MarketWatch. C# developers earn around $68,500 per year.
</p>
<p class="mar-t1">
    C# is also used to build cross-platform mobile applications on the Xamarin platform. By using C#, you can write 
    lengthy programs in just a few lines with Xamarin and then deploy them to both the leading mobile platforms, 
    i.e., iOS and Android, simultaneously.
</p>
<h3 class="mar-t1 font-weight-600">10. Swift</h3>
<p class="mar-t1">
    <a href="https://www.swift.org/" target="blank" class="text-decoration-none text-success">Swift</a> has been in the industry since 2014 and is mostly used for developing applications for 
    iOS. Even though the language is quite new, experts think that it deserves high priority. 
    With features like open-source code and simple syntax, one of its greatest advantages is its 
    superb integration with Objective-C. Also, Swift can be integrated with FlappyBird, Mozilla Firefox, 
    and WordPress.
    An open-source programming language that is easy to learn, Swift supports almost everything from 
    the programming language Objective-C. Swift requires fewer coding skills compared with other 
    programming languages, and it can be used with IBM Swift Sandbox and IBM Bluemix. Swift is used 
    in popular iOS apps like WordPress, Mozilla Firefox, SoundCloud, and even in the game Flappy Bird. 
    Professionals who develop iOS applications take home average annual salaries of around $96,000.
