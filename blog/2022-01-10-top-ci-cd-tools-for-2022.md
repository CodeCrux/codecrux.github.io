## What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for countinous integration and countinous deployment or delivery, CI and CD revolve around three major processes in the development of software: Build, Test and Deploy.

**Continuous integration** integrates the code continuously on the existing code. A popular version controlling system such as Git serves the issues of integrating the code from multiple developers. This is counted as the primary stage of our pipeline. Once we have pushed the code into the shared repository and integrated it, the next stage comes the continuous delivery.

**Continuous Delivery** is the next step and as the name suggests, it aims towards continuously delivering the newly integrated code to the end-users. 


**1) Buddy**

Buddy is a smart CI/CD tool for web developers designed to lower the entry threshold to DevOps. It uses delivery pipelines to build, test and deploy software. The pipelines are created with over 100 ready-to-use actions that can be arranged in any way – just like you build a house of bricks.

**Features:**
- 15-minute configuration in clear & telling UI/UX
- Lightning-fast deployments based on changesets
- Builds are run in isolated containers with cached dependencies
- Supports all popular languages, frameworks & task managers
- Dedicated roster of Docker/Kubernetes actions
- Integrates with AWS, Google, DigitalOcean, Azure, Shopify, WordPress & more
- Supports parallelism & YAML configuration


**2) Jenkins**
Jenkins is an open-source continuous integration tool. It is written using the Java programming language. It is one of the best Continuous Integration tools that facilitates real-time testing and reporting on isolated changes in a larger code base. This software helps developers to quickly find and solve defects in their code base & automate testing of their builds.

**Features:**
- Provide support to scale out to a large number of nodes and distribute the workload equally among them
- Easily updated with all OS and versions of Linux, Mac OS or Windows
- It offers easy installation as Jenkins comes as a WAR file all you need to drop into your JEE container and your setup up ready to run.
- Jenkins can be easily set up and configured with the help of its web interface
- It’s can easily distribute work across several machines,


**3) GoCD**
GoCD is an Open source Continuous Integration server. It is used to model and visualize complex workflows with ease. This CI tool allows continuous delivery and provides an intuitive interface for building CD pipelines.

**Features:**

- Supports parallel and sequential execution. Dependencies can be easily configured.
- Deploy any version, anytime
- Visualize end to end workflow in realtime with Value Stream Map.
- Deploy to production securely.
- Handle user authentication and authorization
- Keep orderly configuration
- Tons of plugins to enhance functionality.
- Active community for help and support.


**4) GoCD**

Circle CI is a flexible CI tool that runs in any environment like cross-platform mobile app, Python API server or Docker cluster. This tool reduces bugs and improves the quality of the application.

**Features:**

- Allows to select Build Environment
- Supports many languages like Linux, including C++, Javascript, NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby
- Support for Docker lets you configure customized environment
- Automatically cancel any queued or running builds when a newer build is triggered
- It split and balance tests across multiple containers to reduce overall build time
- Forbid non-admins from modifying critical project settings
- Improve Android and iOS store rating by shipping bug-free apps.
- Optimal Caching and Parallelism for fast performance.
- Integration with VCS tools


**4)Razorops or Razorci **

Razorops is a complete container native CI/CD solution handling all aspects of the software lifecycle from the moment a commit is created until it is deployed to production.
Razorops has all the capabilities that you would expect from a CI/CD platform such as
1. Code compilation/build
2. Artifact packaging
3. Testing Automation(unit, integration, acceptance etc.)
4. Faster builds and shipping to production

Razorops is a single solution that implements the whole pipeline from start to deployment.
Website : https://razorops.com/

**Features:**

**Container Native**
Software that treats the container as the first-class unit of infrastructure. Razorops gives a fresh isolated environment for every step in your pipeline.

**Connect Environments**
Create new Kubernetes clusters on any server or cloud no matter where they run. Integrate and promote builds across multiple environments according to your needs (development, staging and more).

**Deployment Pipeline**
Manage your entire pipeline visually or put inside your codebase. No scripts, delays and downtime.

**Automatic rollback**
We analyze data from monitoring tools and uses automated testing tools to look for anomalies and failures to rollback broken within seconds.

**Incorporate Gitops**
Align your pipelines with the branch structure, making it easier to work with branching workflows like feature branching or git-flow.

**Code as configuration**
Store and manage your configurations in a single .razorops.yaml file. Only few lines of code to get you started.

**Git as Source Code**
Razorops integrates well with top git based source code management systems like GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab.

**Language Agnostic**
Razorops is language agnostic, it works with any language or service that runs inside a Docker container. You can choose public docker images or use your private images.

**Platform Independent**
Razorops is a cloud based SAAS product, it's a zero installation, quick start platform, you can build your apps for any platform AWS, GCP, Azure, iOS, Android, ReactNative etc.
